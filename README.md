# Arcade Flight Simulator

## Features
This is currently just a very early prototype, so there is not much to speak of here.

## Goals

1. Make a functioning game that closely mimics the gameplay of Ace Combat
2. Design a realistic flight system that allows for fine control over movement
3. Allow the player and AI to chose from a large number of unique planes
